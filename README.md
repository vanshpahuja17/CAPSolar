# CAPSolar
• Aimed to check effect of different atmospheric gases like SOx, COx, NOx, Benzene on the solar panel power generation by setting a threshold value we are predicting that at a particular location.
• Applied Machine Learning algorithms like naïve bayes, SVM, decision tree to get the prediction and learnt how to find threshold values by the recorded readings using visualization tools like PowerBI. Learnt how to use Arduino along with various sensors, posting that data onto the cloud, making Realtime predications and alerting the user about power fluctuation via mail.
